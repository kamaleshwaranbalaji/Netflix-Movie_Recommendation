# Netflix Movie Recommendation System 

## Description:

This repository delves into the fascinating world of movie recommendations for Netflix-like platforms. It provides a foundational framework for analyzing user ratings and uncovering patterns that can guide personalized suggestions.

## Key Features:

- ### Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
    - Cleans and prepares a dataset containing customer ratings for movies.
    - Provides insights into the distribution of ratings, customer and movie counts, and potential missing data patterns.
- ### Visualization:
    - Creates insightful visualizations to help understand user behavior and rating trends.
- ### Movie ID Handling:
    - Incorporates a refined approach to assign unique movie IDs even when dealing with missing ratings, ensuring data integrity.

## Project Goals:

- Gain a deeper understanding of user preferences and movie characteristics that influence ratings.
- Lay the groundwork for building more sophisticated recommendation algorithms using techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot (optional)
- seaborn (optional)

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/netflix-movie-recommendation`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn (optional)`
3. (Optional) Mount your Google Drive if the data resides there.
4. Run the Python script to execute the analysis.

## Future Enhancements:
